# Data structures and algorithms

This project is dedicated to using algorithms to sort data and practice with certain data structures using Javascript. These include mergeSort, graphs, linked lists, hash maps and binary search trees.

## Recursion

This project uses recursion to go over a fibonacci sequence. Furthermore, merge sort algorithm is used to return a sorted array.

Access the [Recursion lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion) requirements on The Odin Project.

## Linked lists

This project uses linked lists and provides methods to add, remove, find and other related methods in the created linked lists.

Access the [Linked lists lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists) requirements on The Odin Project.

## Hash map

This project uses hash maps and provides methods to set, retrieve, remove, includes and other related methods in the created hash maps.

Access the [Hash map lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-hashmap) requirements on The Odin Project.

## Binary Search Trees

This project uses binary search trees where an array of data is turned into a balanced binary tree. Various methods like insert, delete and find are implemented.

## Graphs

This project uses graphs to calculate the shortest path between certain squares in a chess board.

## Run locally

*In order to run project locally NodeJS + Git needs to installed on your system*

Follow these steps on Mac/Linux/WSL to run the project locally:

1. Open a terminal and go to a directory you want the repository to be in
2. Select Code in the Github project page and copy the SSH URL
3. git clone *SSH URL*
4. 'cd' into the repository you just cloned
5. 'cd' into of the sub directories
6. Add console.log statements with the functions and parameters you want to call to the files
7. Save the file and run 'node *filename.js*' in a terminal
